Constructing transient amplifiers for death-Birth updating: A case study of cubic and quartic regular graphs 
by Hendrik Richter

The mat-files Trans_XX_Y.mat are the adjacency matrices of the amplifiers constructors of Y-regular graphs with size XX.



The m-file find_trans_amp1 finds the potential transient amplifiers by the perturbation method 

It uses the function findRemeetingTimes.m
